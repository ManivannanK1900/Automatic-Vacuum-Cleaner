# Working
This model consists of two parts, first part is for the motion of the model and the other is for cleaning. The purpose of Arduino UNO is to control the motion of the cleaner and change direction while encountering any obstacle. Arduino UNO is a programmable microcontroller which is used for controlling sensors, motors, relay etc., by giving and receiving digital signals. The orientation of the model is clearly mentioned in circuit diagram mentioned before. The three ultrasonic sensors and one IR sensors are used to detects an obstacle on the way in all three directions and also the bottom direction. The servo motor is used for changing direction of the device according to the obstacles. DC motors are used for the wheel rotations, sanitizer spraying and sweeping.
# Disclaimer
With the advancement of technology, robots are getting more attention of researchers to make life of mankind comfortable. Due to sudden pandemic situations across the world, the need for robots is essential for avoiding human contact in any form. The main problem in current crisis is cleaning the floors without human contact to virus. Hence this project will very much focus on that matter. This paper presents the design, development and fabrication of prototype robotic vacuum cleaner. Subject robot operates in autonomous mode along with additional features like availability of both dry and wet cleaning and bagless dirt container with large space and easy disposal mechanism. This work can be very useful in improving life style of mankind.
